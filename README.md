# React Starter Kit
My personal take on the React Starter Kit:tm:

Features:
* React
* Redux (using [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) paradigm)
* React Router
* CSS Modules (they're isomorphic!)
* Code Splitting

## Getting Started

```
git clone git@github.com:andrewburgess/react-starter-kit.git your-app
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
